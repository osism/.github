# Welcome to OSISM!

OSISM is developing a solution for the holistic management of sustainable, sovereign
software-defined cloud infrastructures.

OSISM enables fast, easy and consistent management and provisioning of compute, storage and
network resources to run cloud-native applications.

OSISM is used by the [Sovereign Cloud Stack](https://scs.community/) (SCS) to manage
the core infrastructure services.

OSISM is made up of many individual modules. Most modules can also be used independently of
each other.

* OSISM Bare-metal
* OSISM Ceph
* OSISM Identity & Access Management
* OSISM Kubernetes
* OSISM Kubernetes as a Service
* OSISM Logging, Monitoring & Telemetry
* OSISM OpenStack
* OSISM SONiC
