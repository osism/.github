OSISM is developing a solution for the holistic management of sustainable and software-defined cloud infrastructures.

We enable fast, easy and consistent provisioning of compute, storage and network resources to run cloud-native applications.

Our solution provides a solid and stable base for the deployment, operation and lifecycle management of internal cloud infrastructures, for public cloud data centres and, at the edge, for distributed systems. OSISM is also suitable for building true supercomputers and HPC environments.
