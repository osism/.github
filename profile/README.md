# Welcome to OSISM!

OSISM is a comprehensive platform for managing software-defined cloud infrastructure that goes far beyond being a simple deployment tool for OpenStack. While OSISM does support the deployment and management of OpenStack as a key component, its capabilities extend to orchestrating a wide array of services and tools needed to build and operate a modern private cloud. By leveraging OSISM, organizations gain a powerful toolset for building, managing, and scaling private cloud infrastructures tailored to their specific needs, while also maintaining full control over their data and operations.

OSISM is used by the [Sovereign Cloud Stack](https://www.sovereigncloudstack.org) (SCS) to manage
the core infrastructure services. OSISM is SCS compliant.
