## Project description

OSISM is developing a solution for the holistic management of sustainable, sovereign
software-defined cloud infrastructures.

OSISM is used by the [Sovereign Cloud Stack](https://scs.community/) (SCS) to manage
the core infrastructure services.

As the basis for [pluscloud open](https://www.plusserver.com/produkte/pluscloud-open) from
the German-based cloud service provider [PlusServer](https://www.plusserver.com) in Cologne,
OSISM is an integral part of one of the first [Gaia-X](https://www.gaia-x.eu) compatible hosters.

[Wavecon](https://www.wavecon.de/de/), owned by [noris network AG](https://www.noris.de),
also relies on OSISM to set up and operate a completely open, standardised sovereign public
cloud: the [Wavestack](https://www.noris.de/wavestack-cloud).

We enable fast, easy and consistent management and provisioning of compute, storage and
network resources to run cloud-native applications.

Our solution provides a solid and stable base for the deployment, operation and lifecycle
management of on-premise cloud infrastructures, for public cloud data centres and, at the edge,
for distributed systems. OSISM is also suitable for building supercomputers and HPC
environments.

## Documentation

Documentation on OSISM can be found at [docs.osism.tech](https://docs.osism.tech).
The associated repository is [osism/documentation](https://github.com/osism/documentation).

## Issues

If you have found a bug, a feature is missing or you have a question just open a bug in
[osism/issues](https://github.com/osism/issues). We will then move it to the
right place and assign it as soon as possible.

## Matrix

On Matrix we are available via [#osism](https://matrix.to/#/#osism:matrix.org) for problems,
suggestions, feedback etc. around OSISM. We are also happy to discuss topics like OpenStack,
Ceph, and Ansible in general.
