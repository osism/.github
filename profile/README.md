# Welcome to OSISM!

OSISM is developing a solution for the holistic management of sustainable, sovereign
software-defined cloud infrastructures.

OSISM enables fast, easy and consistent management and provisioning of compute, storage and
network resources to run cloud-native applications.

OSISM is used by the [Sovereign Cloud Stack](https://scs.community/) (SCS) to manage
the core infrastructure services.
